                This sounds like a cool, straightforward answer. But for a beginner, this definition might raise further
                questions. So let's break it down and understand what it means. <br>
                Node.js is open-source: This means that the source code for Node.js is publicly available. And it's
                maintained by contributors from all over the world. The Node.js contribution guide shows you how to
                contribute. <br>
                Node.js is cross-platform: Node.js is not dependent on any operating system software. It can work on
                Linux, macOS, or Windows. <br>
                Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment: When you write JavaScript code in your text editor, that
                code cannot perform any task unless you execute (or run) it. And to run your code, you need a runtime
                environment. <br>
                Browsers like Chrome and Firefox have runtime environments. That is why they can run JavaScript code.
                Before Node.js was created, JavaScript could only run in a browser. And it was used to build only
                front-end applications. <br>
                Node.js provides a runtime environment outside of the browser. It's also built on the Chrome V8
                JavaScript engine. This makes it possible to build back-end applications using the same JavaScript
                programming language you may be familiar with.
